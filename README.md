1. MDPS VS POMDPS
- MDPS: fully observable, assume that the state of the system is fully observable i.e. the agent has complete knowledge of the current state of the system and can use this information to make decisions.

2. MDPS might not be valid in real world problems where the past history may be relevant to the future state - POMDPS and RNN, etc are used in that case.
