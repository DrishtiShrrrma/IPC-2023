### Potential Objectives in Planning and Scheduling Problems:
 1. Maximizing Reward - Most common objective!
    - goal: To maximize cumulative reward
  
 2. Minimizing Cost of Executing a Plan- This can involve minimizing the time taken to complete a set of tasks, minimizing resource usage, or minimizing other costs associated with executing a plan.
 
 3. Maximizing Throughput: The objective may be to maximize the number of tasks that can be completed within a given time period. This can involve optimizing the allocation of resources and the scheduling of tasks to maximize overall throughput.
    - Alternatively, Minimizing makespan: The objective may be to minimize the makespan, or the time taken to complete all tasks. This can involve optimizing the allocation of resources and the scheduling of tasks to minimize the overall makespan.
 
 4. Maximizing Fairness/Equity: This can involve ensuring that all tasks or agents are treated equally, or that no individual is unfairly prioritized over others.
