## A) **Some Potential Objectives in Planning and Scheduling Problems:**
 **1. Maximizing Reward:** Most common objective!
    - goal: To maximize cumulative reward
 
 **2. Minimizing Cost of Executing a Plan:** This can involve minimizing the time taken to complete a set of tasks, minimizing resource usage, or minimizing other costs associated with executing a plan.
 
 3. Maximizing Throughput: The objective may be to maximize the number of tasks that can be completed within a given time period. This can involve optimizing the allocation of resources and the scheduling of tasks to maximize overall throughput.
    - Alternatively, Minimizing makespan: The objective may be to minimize the makespan, or the time taken to complete all tasks. This can involve optimizing the allocation of resources and the scheduling of tasks to minimize the overall makespan.
 
 **4. Maximizing Fairness/Equity:** This can involve ensuring that all tasks or agents are treated equally, or that no individual is unfairly prioritized over others.
 
 **5. Maximizing the probability of success:**
 
 **6. Minimizing energy consumption**
 
 **7. Maximizing resource utilization**
 
 **8. Maximizing revenue**
 
 **9. Minimizing environmental impact**
 
 **10. Minimizing risk**
 
 **11. Minimizing congestion**
 
 **12. Maximizing customer satisfaction**
 
 **13. Minimizing downtime**
 
 **14. Minimizing travel time**
 
 **15. Maximizing system reliability**
 
 **16. Minimizing equipment maintenance costs**


# B) Some Potential Objectives that can be Used in Planning and Scheduling **HVAC** Systems using RDDL:

1. Minimizing energy consumption: The objective can be to minimize the energy consumption of the HVAC system, while still maintaining a comfortable indoor environment.

2. Maximizing indoor comfort: The objective can be to maximize the comfort level of the occupants of the building by maintaining a specific temperature, humidity, and air quality.

3. Minimizing equipment maintenance costs: The objective can be to minimize the costs associated with maintenance and repair of the HVAC system by optimizing the use of equipment and minimizing downtime.

4. Minimizing peak demand: The objective can be to reduce the peak demand on the HVAC system during periods of high usage, in order to avoid overload and reduce energy costs.

5. Maximizing system reliability: The objective can be to maximize the reliability of the HVAC system by preventing equipment failures and reducing the need for repairs.

6. Maximizing indoor air quality: The objective can be to maximize the air quality in the indoor environment by reducing the levels of pollutants and maintaining appropriate ventilation.

7. Minimizing HVAC noise: The objective can be to minimize the noise generated by the HVAC system in order to improve the comfort level of the occupants.

8. Minimizing carbon emissions: The objective can be to minimize the carbon emissions associated with the operation of the HVAC system, in order to reduce the environmental impact.

9. Minimizing HVAC footprint: The objective can be to minimize the physical footprint of the HVAC system in order to reduce the amount of space required for installation.

10. Maximizing occupant satisfaction:** The objective can be to maximize the satisfaction level of the occupants by providing a comfortable indoor environment that meets their needs and preferences.
